Projects Description

- EvaluatePolynomial
 	+ Reads input file value to evaluate the polynomial.

- GaussianElimination
	+ The program uses SPP Gaussian Back Substitution and Forward Elimination, calculate and find the solution.

- NumericalRootFindingMethods
	
	 + Have Four methods: Newton Method, Secant Method, Bisection Method, Bisection+Newton Method(Hybrid)

		Newton's method is great for speed, but it does require that you know the derivative.
		
		Secant Method. Well if you can't find the tangent line because you don't know the derivative, estimate it with a secant line instead

		Bisection Method. Guaranteed convergence, provided you can straddle the root at the start.

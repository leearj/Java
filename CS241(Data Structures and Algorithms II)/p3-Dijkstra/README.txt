Project Description
	- Given the data -- city.dat, road.dat, the project should be able to perform:

	#1. Read the original data files and store the data to appropriate data structures.
	
	#2. Let the user of this program enter a city code and your program should print out the city information (the whole record).

	#3. Find the connection between two cities. Get two city codes and find the shortest distance between two cities.

	#4. Insert a road (edge) between two cities -- the user will be asked to enter the two city codes and its distance. Note that if a pair of city codes already exists or if the city code doesn't.

	#5. Delete a road (edge) -- the user will be asked to enter two city codes for this road. Note that if the road entered doesn't exist, print out a warning message.

	#6. Exit.

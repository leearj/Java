Project Description

	Given an input file, setup pid, burst_time, priority values and run CPU scheduling algorithms and calculate the time it took(by manual addition, not system time) for each algorithms. The algorithms are:

	First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
	Shortest-Job-First (SJF)
	Round-Robin with time quantum = 20
	Round-Robin with time quantum = 40
	Lottery with time quantum = 40
	
	After compiling and execute the java code, it will prompt you to type input files (testdata1.txt ~ testdata4.txt) and then type algorithm you want to run.
	The program will output the table on the screen as well as outputing the CSV file.
	The program is infinitely looping so in order to exit, type EXIT or exit. Each iteration generates csv file.
